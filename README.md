# strangeAttractors

## Video Demonstration

I give a video demonstration here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUZP2kvPYYw

## Explanation

Basically, I was [reading about rotation matrices](https://www.scratchapixel.com/lessons/3d-basic-rendering/perspective-and-orthographic-projection-matrix/building-basic-perspective-projection-matrix) and wanted to try out projecting 3d pts onto a 2d plane with pygame. I was also reading about chaotic attractors and used [this page](http://www.3d-meier.de/tut19/Seite0.html) as inspiration.

Altogether, just a kinda casual graphics project.
